SUBJECT: **Effect of the consumption of chocolate on cycling**

Below is the experimental study results about the effect of dark and white chocolate on the all-out sprint performance measuring the distance traveled in meters. The experiment was conducted as crossover design on 9 male participants. A crossover design is a repeated measurements design such that each subject receives the two different treatments (dark chocolate versus white chocolate) during the different two-week time periods, i.e., the patients cross over from one treatment to another during the course of the experiment.

The benefits of crossover design include, this design yield a more efficient comparison of treatments than a parallel design i.e., fewer participants are required in order to attain the same level of statistical results because each participant serves as his/her own matched control. 

From the given details, the p-value for the all-out sprint performance total distance traveled on consumption of the white chocolate over the baseline is 0.319, we conclude that, there is a no significant difference in the performance of the athletes on consumption of the white chocolate.

As the 95% Confidence Interval for the population average change in total distance covered (dark chocolate over baseline) is 165 m to 314 m; (p-value 0.001), As the p-value is less than significant level of 0.05 for 95% confidence interval, we can conclude that there is a significant difference in the all-out performance of the athletes on consumption of the dark chocolate over baseline (with no chocolate consumption)
Considering the null hypothesis as there is no difference in the all-out performance of the athletes by consuming either dark or white chocolate, and alternative hypothesis as there is a difference in all-out performance of the athlete because of dark chocolate over white chocolate consumption. From the given 95% confidence interval (significance level = 0.05), we can conclude that, consumption of dark chocolate was having significant positive difference in all-out performance of the athletes, as the p-value is 0.003 for 95% confidence Interval for the population average change in total distance covered (dark chocolate over white chocolate) is 82 m to 292 m.

**From the provided details, we can conclude that the dark chocolate included in the athletes diet is having a significant effect on the all-out performance measured by total distance traveled in 2 minutes over baseline as well as over white chocolate.**
